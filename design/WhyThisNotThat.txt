When storing data, Redis stores data as specific data types, whereas Memcached only stores data as strings.
Because of this, Redis can change data in place without having to re-upload the entire data value.
This reduces network overhead.

Memcached stores key-value pairs as a String and has a 1MB size limit per value.
However, Redis also supports other data structures like list, set, and hash,
and can store values of up to 512MB in size.
